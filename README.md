Cognitive Biases to CSV
=======================

###What it does
 - Dumps a list of cognitive biases from a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) to CSV for importing into applications like Anki for use as flashcards.

###What it may do, someday
 - Include hyperlinks in name to their corresponding wikipedia articles.

###What it doesn't do (directly)
 - Save the world
 - Create superhuman intelligence
 - Walk your (possibly non-existent) dog
